                            <p>Join Architect David Brand and Canberra Modern in Deakin for a unique 
                                perspective on one of Canberra’s iconic neighbourhoods – recounted as 
                                a raw, new pioneering suburb, built by its unique community of diplomat, 
                                public service and academic families.</p>

                            <p>Growing up in Canberra in the 1950s & ’60s was an immersive Modernist 
                                experience for David Brand, a Melbourne based architect born and raised 
                                in Deakin. Their houses and gardens express the ideals of Modern Australian 
                                living, in a Post-War age of austerity, and optimism.</p>

                                further reflecting on his childhood neighbourhood — its houses, gardens, 
                                society and attitudes, its unique Canberran demographics. </p>

                            <p>Post WWII and entering the cold war era, architects and bureaucrats alike were 
                                prepared for anything. Built in 1954, University House was the crown jewel of 
                                the newly established Australian National University, but more than just 
                                accommodation for staff and students, the building offered a secret safe haven 
                                in the event of a military attack on the capital in the form of complex 
                                underground tunnels. Join Canberra Modern’s Amy Jarvis and Tim the Yowie Man 
                                on a behind the scenes tour of these tunnels and learn how this building, and 
                                the rest of ANU hold a myriad of secrets and mysteries within their design and 
                                history. </p>
